# VaultChatFormatter (For [Dislink](https://github.com/squeeglii/Dislink))

This is just a small fork of [VaultChatFormatter (VCF)](https://github.com/lucko/VaultChatFormatter) which adds a placeholder 
for [Dislink](https://github.com/squeeglii/Dislink) link verifier prefixes. I already use VCF for a project and wanted to tack on another prefix so here we are.

Same licensing as VCF, the Unlicense (so like, no licensing? cool)

Support is not guaranteed at all so set those expectations low ðŸ˜Ž
